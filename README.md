# Bouncing Ball Game with Pygame

## About
This project is a simple interactive game using the Pygame library where a ball bounces around the screen. The ball starts with a random direction and speed, and you can change the ball's movement by clicking anywhere on the screen. This project demonstrates basic concepts of animation, collision detection, and user input in Python.

## Features
- **Interactive Gameplay**: The ball bounces off the walls of the window, and the user can change the ball's speed and direction by clicking the mouse.
- **Colorful Ball**: The ball starts with a randomly assigned color.
- **Customizable Screen**: The screen size, ball speed, and color can easily be modified in the code.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

## Installation
- You can install Pygame using pip:
  ```bash
  pip install pygame

- Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Allminfatima/Bouncing-Ball-with-Pygame.git

## How to Run
- Make sure you have Python and Pygame installed.
- Run the game:
  ```bash
  python bouncing_ball.py

## Output
When you run the game, a window will open with a black background and a colorful ball bouncing around the screen. You can click anywhere on the screen to randomly change the ball's speed and direction.

Here's what the output looks like:

The ball will bounce off the edges of the window and continue moving indefinitely.

## Customization
You can modify the following parameters in the code to customize the game:

- Screen Size: Change the width and height of the game window.
- Ball Radius: Adjust the size of the ball.
- Ball Speed: Change the initial speed of the ball.
- Ball Color: Assign a specific color instead of random colors.
